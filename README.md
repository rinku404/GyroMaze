# GyroMaze
A game made with a custom controll. The player have to move a ball and reach the end of a maze layout. He does that by tilting the plane (the custom controller) in his hand. As a response the whole maze tilts. He also need to deal with incoming obstacles and power ups that may come up along the way.
